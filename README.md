## About Me
Welcome to my profile! Iâ€™m a graduating CS student at Oregon State with a decade of translation experience. Skilled in collaborating with diverse teams and thriving in both onsite and remote environments, I excel at meeting dynamic client requirements and deadlinesâ€”much like adhering to coding standards. Iâ€™m eager to leverage my communication skills and curiosity in an entry-level SWE role or internship, offering fresh solutions.
